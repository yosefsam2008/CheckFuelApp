# Terms of Service - Fuel Cost Calculator App

**Last Updated: December 2025**

## 1. General Agreement

By using the Fuel Cost Calculator App ("the App"), you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.

**Quick Overview:**
1. You enter vehicle details
2. The App calculates fuel/electricity costs
3. Your data is stored only on your device
4. You own your data and are free to delete it anytime

## 2. Important Disclaimer - Results Are Estimates Only

### 2.1 All Calculations Are Estimates
**This is important:** All results from the App are approximations, not exact:
- Fuel consumption varies based on driving (speed, roads, weather)
- Fuel prices change daily in the market
- Government consumption data may be outdated or inaccurate (updated every few months)
- We do not account for: trips, wear and tear, engine efficiency degradation

### 2.2 You Are Responsible for Verification
- Do not rely solely on the data for major financial decisions
- Check actual fuel prices at gas stations
- Check your vehicle's actual consumption from fuel receipts
- Use this as a tool only, not as a single source of truth

### 2.3 We Are Not Liable for Errors
**If you rely on incorrect data from the App:**
- We are not responsible for financial losses
- We are not responsible for calculation errors
- We are not responsible for fuel market fluctuations
- We are not responsible for your decisions based on the data

**Example:**
If the App predicted a cost of ₪100, but the trip cost ₪120 because fuel prices rose, we are not responsible for the difference.

## 3. Intellectual Property and Trademarks

If the government records that your vehicle consumes 15 km/liter, but it actually consumes 12 km/liter - we cannot fix that, only the government can.
